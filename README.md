Kimball
=====

Kimball is an application to manage people that are involved with the Smart Chicago CUT Group.

Features
--------

Kimball is a customer relationship management application at its heart. Kimball tracks people that have signed up to participate with the CUT Group, their involvement in events and CUT Group programs.

Setup
-----
Kimball is a Ruby on Rails app. 

* Server Set up:
  * It currently uses Capistrano for deployment to staging and production instances.
  * ElasticSearch needs to be installed and running for Kimball to work.
  * Environment Variables are used (saved in a local_env.yml file) for API keys and other IDs.
  * you'll need ssh-agent forwarding:
  ```ssh-add -L``
If the command says that no identity is available, you'll need to add your key:

```ssh-add yourkey```
On Mac OS X, ssh-agent will "forget" this key, once it gets restarted during reboots. But you can import your SSH keys into Keychain using this command:

```/usr/bin/ssh-add -K yourkey```
* Wufoo
  * Wufoo hosts all forms used for Kimball.
  * On the Server Side there are 3 environment variables used:
    * WUFOO_ACCOUNT
    * WUFOO_API
    * WUFOO_SIGNUP_FORM
  * For SMS signup and form fills, "SMS Campaigns" are created in the Kimball app to associate a Wufoo form ID.
  * Webhooks are used on Wufoo to send data back to Kimball. Currently there are 2 webhooks in use:
    * /people : This endpoint is used for new signups via the main signup/registration wufoo form.
    * /people/create_sms : This endpoint is used for new signups via the signup/registration Wufoo form that has been customized for SMS signup.
    * /submissions : This endpoint is for all other Wufoo forms (call out, availability, tests). It saves the results in the submissions model. 
* Twilio:
  * Twilio is used to send and receive text messages for sign up, notifications, and surveys.
  * Two Twilio phone numbers are needed. One for text message signup, notifications, and surveys. The other for text message verification.
  * On the Server Side there are several environment variables used:
    * TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
    * TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
    * TWILIO_SMS_SIGNUP_NUMBER
    * TWILIO_SIGNUP_VERIFICATION_NUMBER
  * The email signup verification number uses a request url with HTTP POST endpoint /receive_text/index
  * The SMS Signup/notification number uses a request url with HTTP POST endpoint /receive_text/smssignup
* Mailchimp:
  * Mailchimp is used to send emails.
  * Currently this is a one way connection Kimball --> Mailchimp.
  * On the Server Side there are 2 environment variables used:
    * MAILCHIMP_API_KEY
    * MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID

Candidate releases are tagged from development and deployed to staging, tested, then pushed to master and production.

Development workflow:
Install Vagrant: https://vagrantup.com/
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant up
open http://`whoami`.patterns.dev
